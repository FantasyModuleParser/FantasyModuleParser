A flame-like radiance burns a creature that you can see
within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw or take 1d6 radiant damage, granting you half of the
damage dealt as temporary hit points. The target gains no
benefit from cover for this saving throw.
The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th
level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
