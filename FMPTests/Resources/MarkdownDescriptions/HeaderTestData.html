<p>Embracing the profound intuition inherited from ancestors dating back eons, these barbarians are granted the insight needed to protect their tribe. Many seek to strengthen their connection with these spirits by brandishing tribalistic tattoos and piercings on their bodies to celebrate the deeds of generations past.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ancestral Guidance.</strong></em></p>
<p>In times of conflict, ancestral barbarians call upon their ancestors to join them on the battlefield, disorienting and overwhelming foes by manifesting as spiritual warriors ready to protect their brethren. Should ancestral barbarians fall on the battlefield, they are comforted with the knowledge that their spirits will live on in the afterlife, guiding future generations.</p>
