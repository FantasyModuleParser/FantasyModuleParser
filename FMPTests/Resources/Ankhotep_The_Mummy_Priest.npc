Special Equipment. Ankhotep wears an ornate gold breastplate (worth 950 gp) and a necklace of prayer beads (blessing and curing). He carries a staff of the python and a pearl of power.
Spellcasting. Ankhotep is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). Ankhotep has the following  spells prepared:\rCantrips (At will): guidance, necrotic flame, resistance, sand blast �\r1st level (4 slots): command, desiccating touch, inflict wounds �\r2nd level (3 slots): hold person, spiritual weapon �\r3rd level (2 slots): bestow curse, sand shape
ACTIONS
Rotting Fist. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. A cursed target can't regain hit points, and its maximum hit points decrease by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust.\rThe curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.
Dreadful Glare. Ankhotep targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of him. If the target can see Ankhotep, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic, or become frightened until the end of Ankhotep's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.
