ACTIONS
Cloven Hammer. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) bludgeoning damage. So
long as Tivishta wields the cloven hammer, she can cast
void strike at will.
A Thousand Hooves (1/day). Tivishta summons the
crushing power of the black goat to sunder the earth
and scatter her enemies. All creatures caught in a
30-foot cone must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving
throw. Any that fail are knocked prone and trampled
by spectral hooves, taking 44 (8d10) force damage.
Creatures that aren't knocked prone are instead pushed
10 feet out of the cone’s area.
