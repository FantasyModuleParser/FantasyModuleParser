ACTIONS
Multiattack. Anton attacks twice with the horn blade.
Horn Blade. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage plus
another 1d4 slashing damage at the start of each
of Anton's turns until the bleeding is stopped with a
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check or with any
amount of magical healing. If the horn blade is under
the effect of Anton’s nether weapon spell, Anton gains 5
temporary hit points, to a maximum of 10 at one time,
each time he successfully damages a creature.
Bleat of the Ram's Horn. As an action, Anton blows a
ram’s horn. The tuneless bleating transforms Anton’s
body, granting him the shape of his patron. His feet
become cloven (Speed 40 feet), his eyes grow and
turn yellow (truesight 60 feet), his body is covered in
wiry black hair (resistance to slashing damage), and his
knees bend backward and thick muscle wraps around
his haunches (jump distances doubled). This shape lasts
until he ends it (no action required on his part).
