Innate Spellcasting. The marilith's innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 19). The marilith can innately cast the
following spells, without providing material components:
At will: detect magic
3/day each: fly, polymorph (self only), telekinesis
1/day each: blade barrier, project image
Magic Resistance. The demon has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.
Magic Weapons. The marilith's weapon attacks are magical.
Reactive. The marilith can take one reaction on every turn in a
combat.
Actions
Multiattack. The marilith makes seven attacks: six with its
longswords and one with its tail.
Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison
damage.
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature.
Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or
smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the
target is restrained, the marilith can automatically hit the target with
its tail, and the marilith can't make tail attacks.
Bladestorm (Recharges 5-6). The marilith moves up to its walking
speed and targets each creature within 5 feet of it during its
movement. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving
throw or take 43 (6d12 +5) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6) poison
damage. The marilith's movement during this action will not provoke
opportunity attacks.
Ruthless Command (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). For
1 minute, the marilith can issue a telepathic command whenever
a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an
attack roll. The creature takes 1d8 psychic damage and can add a
d12 to its roll provided it can understand the marilith. A creature
can benefit from only one ruthless command die at a time. This
effect ends if the marilith is incapacitated.
Teleport. The marilith magically teleports, along with any equipment
it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it
can see.
Legendary Actions
The marilith can take three legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a
time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The marilith
regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
Command. The marilith targets one ally it can see within 30 feet of
it. If the target can see and hear the marilith, the target can make
one weapon attack as a reaction and gains advantage on the attack
roll.
Longsword. The marilith makes a longsword attack.
Teleport (Costs 2 Actions). The marilith magically teleports, along
with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an
unoccupied space it can see.
Tail Swipe (Costs 3 Actions). Each creature within 10 feet of the
marilith must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw, taking
20 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone on a
failed save, or half as much damage and isn't knocked prone on a
successful one. The marilith can't use Tail Swipe if it has a creature
grappled with its tail.
Reactions
Parry. The marilith adds 6 to its AC against one melee attack that
would hit it. To do so, the marilith must see the attacker and be
wielding a melee weapon.
