# NPC-Engineer
Engineer Suite is a set of Windows programs designed to facilitate the process of getting data into Fantasy Grounds.
Active modules:
   * NPC Engineer       : Handles all NPC creation and import.
   * Spell Engineer     : Handles all custom spell creation and import.
   * Table Engineer     : Handles the creation and linking of rollable tables.
   * Equipment Engineer : Handles all item creation, listing and import.
   * Project Engineer   : Manages projects and data storage.
   * Parse Engineer     : Builds a module for Fantasy Grounds.
The program comprises 3 main parts at the moment:

Enable the import of NPCs/Spells/Equipment from a variety of sources (PDFs, D&D Beyond, CritterDB, RPG Tinker and others);
Edit the imported information;
Parse to produce a bestiary module for Fantasy Grounds.
It is also possible to create NPCs/Spells/Equipment/Tables from scratch, save them individually, and save to a file for later parsing.
Images and tokens are handled as smoothly as possible - both are copied to the correct directory and renamed properly to make the process of building a bestiary as quick and as accurate as possible.
The module file produced has a reference section which mimics the Monsters Manual, and NPCs import spell information automatically when opened or added to the combat tracker (assuming you have the source book required open). All NPC functions are fully supported - Actions, Legendary Actions, Lair Actions, Spellcasting and so on.

More information can be found on the website - www.masq.net - or in the user manual.
